# Todo

These are things that will likely be implemented in the future.

* Comply to the full [SoundFont 2.04 specification](http://www.synthfont.com/sfspec24.pdf).
  * Add support for 24-bit data samples.
  * Better checks if a SoundFont is valid.
  * ~~Support for global preset and instrument zones.~~
* Maybe add support for sfArk compressed SoundFont files.
* Add option to create, edit and save SoundFonts.
* Increase unit test coverage.
* Improve documentation.
